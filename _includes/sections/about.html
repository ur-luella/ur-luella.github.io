    I'm mostly doing medical data analysis. Solving the deep learning algorithm is just like solving a problem. I'm particularly interested in finding patterns hidden in the flow of time series data. So far, I've only covered EHR data, but I want to deal with ECG data. Recently, I am very interested in Kagle. I hope one day I will win the prize in the Kaggle competition.
